# Example Fansub repo
Formatted as "/XXXXXXX/yyyyyy.json" where XXXXXXXX is the movie ID (found in netflix.com/watch/XXXXX - eg Leo's movie ID is "81218917") and yyyyyyy.json.<br/>
If you hosted a fan-sub called "XYNZ" (X Y And Z) and had a fansub for "Leo" in the "subs" folder of "example.com", the URL would be:
```
https://www.example.com/subs/81218917/XYNZ.json
